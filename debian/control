Description: the simple & fast video cutter & joiner with the help of mpv + FFmpeg
 Cross-platform Qt5 based app for quick and easy video trimming/splitting and merging/joining for simple quick edits.
 FFmpeg dives the backend with a stylishly hand edited Qt5 UI. FFmpg static binary is pre-installed for Windows builds.
 For non-windows, use your o/s package manager if on Linux and homebrew for Mac OS X to manage FFmpeg. It is most
 likely already installed on your Linux or macOS machine.
