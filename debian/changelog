vidcutter (3.0.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * complete rewrite of multimedia backend which now uses libmpv to drive
     video viewing and enables frame stepping for greater accuracy in cutting.
     this has greatly shortened to the list of dependcies to enable this app to
     work and should allow for quicker and easier installation for all users.

  * frame level accuracy when stepping through video via cursor keys or mouse
     wheel. see the new Keyboard Shortcuts menu option for more details.

  * improved UI in many areas including main toolbar redesign.

  * keyboard shortcuts now advertised to user view new menu option

  * exception handing improved with all errors, even those not surfaced to user,
     are logged. application log file can be viewed by the user via new menu
     option.

  * mediainfo library now used to generate metadata for media information which
    works a million times better than what the previous gstreamer codecs had to
    offer.

  * hardware accelerated video via vdpau or vaapi depending on what user has
    installaed. this is all dependant on libpmpv which is the by far the best
    multimedia library in the opensource world. fallback options also exist if
    user has no power codecs installed so things should all still work on a
    minimual workstation setup.

  * many UI fixes and improvements that I cannot be bothered to list but 
    should overall make the app feel much more professional than ever before :-)

vidcutter (2.6.5-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * major fixes to ensure frame accuracy between player and backend. once loaded
    a video framerate is estimated and seeking/stepping by a single step, using 
    arrow keys or mouse wheel should be closest to a single frame in either
    direction. when marking cut points the point in time to the millisecond is also
    communicated to the backend. this will all improve even further with the next
    major release which will encompass a move away from Qt's QMediaPlayer
    widgets which utilise GStreamer (Linux/Mac) and DirectShow (Windows) to a
    libmpv (MPV player) based client.

  * command line argument support added. run the app from the command line
     with --help or -h for the details.

  * major code restructure for a more pluggable/adaptable architecture ie.
    in future, w/ libmpv if for some reason system cannot support it then
    fallback to existing backend (what we have now w/ GStreamer etc.)

vidcutter (2.5.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * video seeking is now closer to a frame rather and no longer a one second
     interval

  * shortcut keys for seeking video updated for frame stepping changes
     (i.e. left-right / mouse wheel = 1 step; up-down = 10 steps)

  * early & basic support for EDLs. Only the very simple MPlayer EDL standard 
     is currently supported but this now allows you to save your clip index for 
     a particular video and reload it again in future for recutting etc. If users
     are using VidCutter and would like interchangeable file format support with
     other tools, like ComSkip for example, then submit a feature request at the
     app's GitHub page (more likely to get noticed there rather than launchpad.net)

  * custom mouse cursor when mouse is over the slider handle (Linux only). this 
     always worked for Windows and macOS but the cursor is missing in X11
     standard themes. i think it gives the app more character so gave Linux the
     needed love it deserves.

  * various UI improvements incl. new app icon care of the papirus crew
     at https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam (thx!)

  * bug fixes; the filename set by default in the save video file dialog is now
     the original video's filename with '_EDIT' appended to help avoid accidental
     writing over original source material.

  * i've probably forgotten a number of other important changes and additions
    but its too late to bother sifting through git logs ;-)

vidcutter (2.2.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * UI improvements + fixes for Windows and macOS
  
  * removed qtawesome dependency so icons are now PNG based; this cuts
    out annoying dependencies allowing for much smaller builds and
    simplified distribution packages in Linux and Pypi
