vidcutter (2.5.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * video seeking is now by frame rather than one second intervals
  * shortcut keys for seeking video updated for frame stepping changes
     (i.e. left-right / mous wheel = 1 frame; up-down = 10 frames)

  * early & basic support for EDLs. Only the very simple MPlayer EDL standard 
     is currently supported but this now allows you to save your clip index for 
     a particular video and reload it again in future for recutting etc. If users
     are using VidCutter and would like interchangeable file format support with
     other tools, like ComSkip for example, then submit a feature request at the
     app's GitHub page (more likely to get noticed there rather than launchpad.net)

  * custom mouse cursor when mouse is over the slider handle (Linux only). this 
     always worked for Windows and macOS but the cursor is missing in X11
     standard themes. i think it gives the app more character so gave Linux the
     needed love it deserves.

  * various UI improvements incl. new app icon care of the papirus crew
     at https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam (thx!)

  * bug fixes; the filename set by default in the save video file dialog is now
     the original video's filename with '_EDIT' appended to help avoid accidental
     writing over original source material.

  * i've probably forgotten a number of other important changes and additions
    but its too late to bother sifting through git logs ;-)

vidcutter (2.2.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * UI improvements + fixes for Windows and macOS

    out annoying dependencies allowing for much smaller builds and
    simplified distribution packages in Linux and Pypi
